# DesignGenerator
Final Project for MSDS Deep Learning course.

Our goal is to bring a designerâ€™s sketch to life. Given a sketch of a couch, our model will generate what the potential design would look like - cutting the time a designer would spend in digitally rendering their design.

Possible benefits that may arise from this project are equipping designers to: 
- Create a polished design in as little time as possible, which allows them to prototype through plans faster.
- Experiment with different styles and style combinations, saving them time during the brainstorming phase.
